   ```bash
   cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease
   ```
2. Create a new GitHub Release and upload the APK file from:
   ```
   android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
   ```
3. Tag the release with a version number (e.g., v1.0.0)

### iOS Archive
1. Open the Xcode workspace:
   ```bash
   cd ios && open crudTask.xcworkspace
   ```
2. Select Product > Archive in Xcode

## üîÑ Data Synchronization
- The app automatically syncs with the CouchDB server when online
- All changes made offline are queued and synced when connectivity is restored
- Conflict resolution is handled automatically by CouchDB

## ü§ù Contributing
1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app ‚Äî you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes ‚Äî¬†this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
